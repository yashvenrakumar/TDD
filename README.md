## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).


1-An empty string returns zero
2-A single number returns the value
3-Two numbers, comma delimited, returns the sum
4-Two numbers, newline delimited, returns the sum
5-Three numbers, delimited either way, returns the sum
6-Negative numbers throw an exception
7-Numbers greater than 1000 are ignored
